<h3>Perl</h3>

We have covered only a small amount of Perl in lectures. In fact, to
cover the whole language in detail would take a whole semester, so
we're going to rely on you finding out about the language yourself
in tutes, labs and assignments. A good place to start is
the Perl documentation & tutorial links on the class home page
For example you might find these useful:

<ul>
<li> <a target="doc" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlsyn.pod">Perl language syntax</a>
<li> <a target="doc" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlsub.pod">Perl functions</a>
<li> <a target="doc" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlop.pod">Perl operators</a>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this lab you will write a Perl program which given the lyrics of a song, prints who the artist is.
You will use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Document_Classification">Naive Bayes Document classifier</a> to do this.
Naive Bayes Document classifiers are used widely for applications such as spam filtering and
language recognition.

<h3>Dataset</h3>

This <a href="{{directory_url}}lyrics.zip">zip file</a> contains
the lyrics of the songs of 10 well known artists.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">wget -q {{directory_url}}lyrics.zip</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">unzip lyrics.zip</kbd>
Archive:  lyrics.zip
   creating: lyrics/
  inflating: lyrics/David_Bowie.txt
  inflating: lyrics/Adele.txt
  inflating: lyrics/Metallica.txt
  inflating: lyrics/Rage_Against_The_Machine.txt
  inflating: lyrics/Taylor_Swift.txt
  inflating: lyrics/Keith_Urban.txt

  inflating: song0.txt

  inflating: song2.txt
  inflating: song3.txt
  inflating: song4.txt
</pre>

The lyrics for each song have been re-ordered to avoid copyright concerns.
<p>
The zip file also contains lyrics from 5 songs where we don't know the artists.

{{execute("cat song0.txt;cat song1.txt;cat song2.txt;cat song3.txt;cat song4.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

They are each from one of the artists in the dataset but they are not from
a song in the dataset.

<h3>Exercise: Total Words</h3>

Write a Perl script <code>total_words.pl</code> which counts the total number of words
found in its input (<code>STDIN</code>).
<p>
For the purposes of this program and the following programs we will define a word to
be maximal non-empty contiguous sequences of alphabetic characters (<code>[a-zA-Z]</code>).
<p>
Any characters other than <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> separate words.
<p>
So for example the phrase "<code>The soul's desire</code>" contains 4 words: <code>("The", "soul", "s", "desire")</code>
<p>
For example:

{{execute("./total_words.pl <lyrics/Justin_Bieber.txt;./total_words.pl <lyrics/Metallica.txt;./total_words.pl <lyrics/Rihanna.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

<b>Hint</b>: if your word counts are out a little you might be counting empty strings (split can return these).
As usual:

{{autotest_reminder("total_words.pl")}}

<div class="answer">
Straight-forward solution using split for total_words.pl

{{include_code("solutions/total_words.v1.pl")}}

More concise solution for total_words.pl

{{include_code("solutions/total_words.v2.pl")}}

</div>





<h3>Exercise: Count Word</h3>

Write a Perl script <code>count_word.pl</code> which counts the number of times
a specified word is found in its input (<code>STDIN</code>).
<p>
A word is as defined for the previous exercise.
<p>
The word you should count will be specified as a command line argument.
<p>
You program should ignore the case of words.
<p>
For example:

{{execute("./count_word.pl death <lyrics/Metallica.txt;./count_word.pl death <lyrics/Justin_Bieber.txt;./count_word.pl love <lyrics/Ed_Sheeran.txt;./count_word.pl love <lyrics/Rage_Against_The_Machine.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

<b>Hint</b>: modify the code from the last exercise.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: the Perl functions <code>uc</code> & <code>lc</code> convert strings to lowercase & uppercase respectively.
<p>

{{autotest_reminder("count_word.pl")}}

<div class="answer">
Sample solution for count_word.pl

{{include_code("solutions/count_word.pl")}}

</div>


<h3>Exercise: Word Frequency</h3>

Write a Perl script <code>frequency.pl</code>
which prints the frequency with which each artist uses a  word specified as an argument.
<p>
So if Justin Bieber  uses the word <b>"love"</b> 493 times in the 46583 words of his songs, then its frequency is <code>493/46583 = 0.0105832599875491</code>.
<p>
For example:


{{execute("./frequency.pl love", cwd="solutions")}}

So of these artists, Ed Sheeran uses the word <b>"love"</b> most frequently.
If you choose a word a randomly from an Ed Sheeran song the probability it will be "love"
is just over in 1 in a hundred (1%).
<p>
Make sure your Perl script produces exactly the output above (the printf format is <code>"%4d/%6d = %.9f %s\n"</code>).
<p>
Note you should ignore case (change A-Z to a-z).
<p>
You should treat as a word any sequence of alphabetic characters.
<p>
You should treat non-alphabetic characters (characters other than a-z) as spaces.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: use a hash table of hash tables indexed by artist and word to store the word counts.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: this loop executes once for each <code>.txt</code> file in the directory <code>lyrics</code>.
<pre class="program">
    foreach $file (glob "lyrics/*.txt") {
        print "$file\n";
    }
</pre>
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: reuse code from the last exercise.

{{autotest_reminder("frequency.pl")}}

<div class="answer">

Sample solution for frequency.pl

{{include_code("solutions/frequency.pl")}}

<h3>Exercise: Word Log Probability</h3>

Now suppose we have the song line <b>"truth is beauty"</b>. If David Bowie uses the
word <b>"truth"</b> with frequency 0.000146727 and the
word <b>"is"</b> with frequency 0.005898407, the word <b>"beauty"</b> with frequency 0.000264108.
We can estimate the probability of Bowie writing the phrase <b>"truth is beauty"</b>
as:

<pre class="program">
0.000146727 * 0.005898407 * 0.000264108 == 2.28573738067596e-10
</pre>

We could similarly estimate probabilities for each of the other 9 artists, and
then determine which of the 10 artists is most likely to sing <b>"truth is beauty"</b> (it's Leonard Cohen).
<p>
A sidenote: we are actually making a large simplifying assumption in calculating this probability. It is
often  called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words_model"><b>bag of words model</b></a>.
<p>
Multiplying probabilities like this quickly leads to very small numbers and may result in
arithmetic underflow of our floating point representation.
A common solution to this underflow is instead to  work with the <b>log</b> of the numbers.
<p>
So instead we will calculate the the log of the probability of the phrase.
You this by adding the log of the probabilities of each word. For example,
you calculate the log-probability of Bowie singing the phrase <b>"Truth is beauty."</b> like this:

<pre class="program">
log(0.000146727) + log(0.005898407) + log(0.000264108) == -22.1991622527613 == log(2.28573738067596e-10)
</pre>

Log-probabilities can be used directly to determine the most likely artist, as the artist
with the highest log-probability will also have the highest probability.
<p>
Another problem is that we might be given a word that an artist has not used in the dataset we
have.  For example:

{{execute("./frequency.pl fear", cwd="solutions")}}

It is not useful to assume there is zero probability that <b>Ed Sheeran</b> would use the word <b>fear</b>
in a song even though he hasn't used it previously.
<p>
You should avoid this when estimating probabilities by adding 1 to the count of occurrences
of each word. So for example we'd estimate the probability of Ed Sheeran using the word
<b>fear</b> as (0+1)/18205 and the probability of Metallica using the word
<b>fear</b> as (39+1)/38082.
This is a simple version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing">Additive smoothing</a>.
<p>
Write a perl script <code>log_probability.pl</code> which given an argument prints the estimate
log of the probability that an artist would use this word. For example:

{{execute("./log_probability.pl fear", cwd="solutions")}}

You will only need to copy your <code>frequency.pl</code> and make a small modification.
Make sure your output matches the above exactly (the printf format is <code>"log((%d+1)/%6d) = %8.4f %s\n"</code>)

{{autotest_reminder("log_probability.pl")}}

<div class="answer">
Sample solution for log_probability.pl

{{include_code("solutions/log_probability.pl")}}

</div>

<h3>Exercise: Identifying the Artist</h3>

Write a Perl script <code>identify_artist.pl</code> that given 1 or more files, each containing   part of song),
prints the most likely artist to have sung those words.
<p>
In other words, for each file given as argument you should go through all (10) artists calculating
the log-probability that the artist sung those words  by summing the
log-probability of that artist using each word in the file.
You should print the artist with the highest log-probability.
<p>
Your program should produce exactly this output:

{{execute("./identify_artist.pl song?.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

<b>Hint:</b> only read each file once.  Store the data in a (2-dimensional) hash.
If you read the files many times your program will be very slow and exceed autotest time limits.

<p>
You may find it helpful to add a '-d' flag which provides debugging information (this is optional),
for example:

{{execute("./identify_artist.pl -d song2.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

<b>Hint:</b> you may like to create simpler input to use in debugging, for example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">echo Andrew Rocks &gt;andrew_rocks.txt</kbd>
</pre>


{{execute("./log_probability.pl Andrew;./log_probability.pl Rocks;./identify_artist.pl -d andrew_rocks.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

<b>Hint:</b> if a word appears multiple times its log-probability needs to be summed multiple times.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">echo echo echo &gt;echo.txt</kbd>
</pre>

{{execute("cat echo.txt;./log_probability.pl echo;./identify_artist.pl -d echo.txt", cwd="solutions")}}

{{autotest_reminder("identify_artist.pl")}}

<div class="answer">
Sample solution for identify_artist.pl

<h3>Challenge Exercise: Introduction</h3>

Re-implement the above exercises in Python.
<p>
The <a href="../../code/python">example Python scripts</a> and links
to external Python resources should help - but you will need more info - Google is your friend.
<p>
<b>Hints</b> for <code>total_words.py</code> &amp;  <code>count_word.py</code>:
<p>
This loop executes for each line of stdin:

<pre class="program">
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    print line
</pre>

The function <code>re.split</code> or the function <code>re.findall</code> could be used to separate words.
<p>
<b>Hints</b> for <code>frequency.py</code>, <code>log_probability.py</code> & <code>identify_artist.py</code>:
<p>
Beware Python dicts need a slightly different approach to Perl hashes, and also
Perl & Python division have different semantics.
<p>
This loop executes once for each <code>.txt</code> file in the directory <code>artists</code>.

<pre class="program">
import glob
for file in glob.glob("lyrics/*.txt"):
    print file
</pre>

<p>
You might find <code>math.log</code>, <code>sorted</code>, <code>re.sub</code> and  <code>collections.defaultdict</code> useful.
