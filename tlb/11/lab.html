<h3>Exercise: A Flask Guessing Game</h3>

In this exercise you will finish  a Python program <b>game.py</b>
which uses Flask to provide a web server which allows users to
play the simple number guessing game from last week.

<h4>Reference Implementation</h4>


Your finished <b>game.py</b> should match the behaviour of this <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/lab/11/game.cgi/start">reference implementation</a>
<p>
To help you understand what you need to do

<ul>
<li> the left window below shows the rendered output from <code>game.cgi</code>
<li> and the right window shows the raw HTML
</li></li></ul>


{{  show_cgi_example("https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/lab/11/game.cgi/start") }}


<h4>Starting Code</h4>

To help you get started here is <a href="game.zip">zip file</a> containing most of the application.


These commands will copy the starting code into an appropriate
place in your CSE account.


<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">mkdir -p ~/public_html/{{exercise_name}}</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">cd ~/public_html/{{exercise_name}}</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">chmod 755 . ..</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">wget {{directory_url}}game.zip</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">unzip game.zip</kbd>
Archive:  game.zip
  inflating: game.cgi
  inflating: game.py
  inflating: game_base.html
  inflating: game_guess.html
  inflating: game_start.html
<kbd class="shell">chmod 700 *.py *.cgi</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">chmod 600 *.html</kbd>
</pre>

Now start <b>game.py</b> as a webserver (you will need to do this on a lab machine not a CSE login server):

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./game.py</kbd>
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 204-542-564
</pre>

If you visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/start">http://127.0.0.1:5000/start</a>
you should be able to play the HTML guessing game.
<p>
But note that when you play the game it doesn't stop when you
guess the number - <b>your task is to fix this</b>.

<h4>Jinja files</h4>

Look at the contents of <code>game_base.html</code>, <code>game_guess.html</code> and  <code>game_start.html</code>
<p>
Hopefully the discussion in the tute  has helped you understand their contents.
<p>
You don't need to change these files.
<p>
You do need to add a similar file (call it <b>game_success.html</b>) for the page to show
at the finish of the game.

<h4>Hints</h4>
<b>DO NOT</b>: change the the files <code> game.cgi</code>, <code>game_base.html</code>,  <code>game_guess.html</code> or  <code>game_start.html</code>.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> you need to add a few lines of code to <code>game.py</code>.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> you need to create a new template file (<b>game_success.html</b>) for the page to show when the game is over.
<p>
<h4>Running game.py as a CGI Script</h4>
<b>game.cgi</b> allows you to also run <b>game.py</b> as a CGI script by entering this URL in a browser <code>http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~<i>z5555555</i>/{{exercise_name}}/game.cgi/start</code>.
<p>
You don't need to use <b>game.cgi</b> for this exercise - you can just run <code>game.py</code> as a webserver - so you can ignore it.

<h4>Peer Assessment</h4>

There is no autotest and no automarking of this question.
<p>
When you have completed demonstrate your work to another COMP[29]041 student in your lab
and ask them to enter a
<a href="{{canonical_url}}/peer_assess/{{exercise_name}}">peer assessment here</a>
It is prefered you do this during your lab, but if this is not possible
you may demonstrate your work to any COMP[29]041  student before the due date.

<h3>Exercise: Peer Assessment in Flask</h3>

In this exercise you will finish  a Python program <b>peer.py</b>
which uses Flask to provide a web server which allows COMP[29]041 students to
assess each others work.

<h4>Reference Implementation</h4>

</pre>

If you visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>
you should be able to assess students.

<h4>Jinja files</h4>

Look at the contents of <code>peer_base.html</code>,  <code>peer_login.html</code>,  <code>peer_select_student.html </code> or <code>peer_enter_grade.html</code>
<p>
Hopefully the discussion in the tute has helped you understand their contents.
<p>
Don't panic if there are parts you don't understand.
You can figure out as much as you need to know.
<p>
You don't need to change these files.
<p>
The reference implementation has a button "See Other Students Assessment of Your Work"
which shows a student a summary of how they have been assessed by other students including a median grade.
<p>
Your task is to add this missing page. Note: calculating the median grade will be a challenge excercise.
<p>
You will need to add code to <code>peer.py</code> and create a new template file.
Call this template file <b>peer_assessments.html</b>
<p>
Don't change <code>peer.cgi</code>, <code>peer_base.html</code>,  <code>peer_login.html</code>,  <code>peer_select_student.html </code> or <code>peer_enter_grade.html</code>
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: check out how assessments are stored in files in the sub-directory <code>assessments</code>.
<b>peer.zip</b> already contains some pre-entered assessments - and you can enter more.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: look at the other Jinja files for the syntax you need to use in <b>peer_assessments.html</b>
<h3>Exercise: Adding Authentication</h3>

You will note that the code you have been given is missing code to
authenticate the user.
<p>
It will let you login in with any zid or password.
<p>
Change this to behave the same as the reference implementation.
<p>
You need to fix this by adding some lines of code to <b>peer.py</b>
<p>
Don't change <code>peer.cgi</code>, <code>peer_base.html</code>,  <code>peer_login.html</code>,  <code>peer_select_student.html </code> or <code>peer_enter_grade.html</code>
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> check out how how the reference implementation behaves when given
the wrong password and how it behaves when given a zid that doesn't exist.


<b>Hint:</b> <b>peer.py</b> already contains code which reads the zids
and passwords in <a href="students.txt">students.txt</a> into a dict.


<h3>Challenge Exercise: Showing Students How They Have Been Assesed</h3>

The reference implementation has a button "See Other Students Assessment of Your Work"
which shows a student a summary of how they have been assessed by other students including a median grade.
<p>
Your task is to calculate and display the median grade.
<p>
You will need to add code to <code>peer.py</code> and update the template file <b>peer_assessments.html</b>
<p>
Don't change <code>peer.cgi</code>, <code>peer_base.html</code>,  <code>peer_login.html</code>,  <code>peer_select_student.html </code> or <code>peer_enter_grade.html</code>
<p>
<b>Hint</b> calculating a median grade can be awkward when there is an even number
number of assessments.  Check out what the reference implementation does.
<p>
Side note: for the lab exercises we have had just one assessor, for assignment 2 you will
have ~5 assessors and you will get the median of their grades for each part of the assignment 2 assessment.


<h4>Running peer.py as a CGI Script</h4>
<b>peer.cgi</b> allows you to also run <b>peer.py</b> as a CGI script by entering this URL in a browser <code>http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~<i>z5555555</i>/{{exercise_name}}/peer.cgi/start</code>.
<p>
You don't need to use <b>peer.cgi</b> for this exercise - you can just run <code>peer.py</code> as a webserver.

<h4>Peer Assessment</h4>

<p>
When you have completed demonstrate your work to another COMP[29]041 student in your lab
and ask them to enter a

you may demonstrate your work to any COMP[29]041  student before the due date.

<h3>Challenge Exercise: Cheating in the Guessing Game</h3>

Can you figure out how to extract the number from the session cookie for the guessing game?
<p>
Sorry no marks for this exercise but you'll learn a lot figuring it out.
