<h3>Exercise: Unique Echo</h3>

Write a Python program <b>uniq_echo.py</b> that prints each different command-line argument to
standard output exactly once, similar to <b>echo</b> command in shell but with duplicates removed.

Print out the unique arguments in order of their first appearance.

{{execute("./uniq_echo.py echo echo echo;./uniq_echo.py bird cow bird cow fish bird cow fish bird;./uniq_echo.py how much wood would a woodchuck chuck;./uniq_echo.py d c b d c a a d;./uniq_echo.py", cwd='solutions')}}

{{autotest_reminder("uniq_echo.py")}}

<div class="answer">
Obvious (readable) Python solution

{{include_code("solutions/uniq_echo.v1.py")}}

More concise Python solution

{{include_code("solutions/uniq_echo.v2.py")}}

</div>


<h3>Exercise: Sort Words</h3>

Write a Python program <b>sort_words.py</b> that reads lines of text from its standard input
and prints them to its standard output with the words on each line rearranged to be in sorted (alphabetic) order.
<p>
You can assume that a word is any sequence of non-whitespace characters.
<p>
You should print the words separated by a single space character.
<p>
For example:

{{execute("./sort_words.py", cwd='solutions', input=
"""I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere     ages and ages hence
Two roads diverged in a   wood and I
I took   the one   less traveled by
And that has made all the difference
""")}}

<div class="answer">
Obvious (readable) Python solution

{{include_code("solutions/sort_words.v1.py")}}

More concise Python solution

{{include_code("solutions/sort_words.v2.py")}}

</div>




<h3>Exercise: Distinct Lines</h3>

Write a Python program <b>distinct_lines.py</b> which given a single argument <b>n</b>
reads lines from standard input until  <b>n</b>
different lines have been read.
<p>
It should then print a message (exactly as below) indicating  how many lines were read.
It should then stop. It should not read futher input
<p>
If end-of-input is reached before <b>n</b> different lines
it should print a message  indicating  how many lines were read.
<p>
Your program should ignore case and white-space when comapring lines.
<p>
You can assume your program is given a single positive integer as argument.

{{execute("./distinct_lines.py 3", cwd='solutions', show_eof=False, input=
"""hi
hello world
hi
hello world
hello world
bye
"""
)}}

{{execute("./distinct_lines.py 3", cwd='solutions', show_eof=False, input=
"""hi
hello world
   hi
hello        world
   HELLO  world
bye
"""
)}}


{{execute("./distinct_lines.py 4", cwd='solutions', show_eof=False, input=
"""how
are
you
are
how
are
well
"""
)}}

{{execute("./distinct_lines.py 3", cwd='solutions', show_eof=False, input=
"""how
are
you
"""
)}}

{{execute("./distinct_lines.py 7", cwd='solutions', input=
"""hello
how
are
you
"""
)}}

No error checking is necessary.
