ndias
 a traveller from an antique land Who said: `Two vast and trunkless
of stone Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, Half sunk,
ttered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of
command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet
ve, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them
he heart that fed.
n the pedestal these words appear --
ame is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty,
espair!"
ng beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless
are The lone and level sands stretch far away.'
